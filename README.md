# Peri Central Bot login app. #
## NOTICE ##
## The purpose of this app is to test the integrity of Nando's employee's peri central accounts. Should any accounts be compromised, it serves as indication that higher security be enforced to protect employee information. ##
#### This app works by using employee names as peri central usernames. These names are scraped from Adii. There are no algorithm's to determine passwords, therefore requiring manual insertation of a specific password to test against all potential usernames. ####
#### Use of common passwords is recommended, such as their own name, or the default "periperi" that is supplied upon account activation. ####
#### Using bash, use node index.js. This will direct the puppet app to use the names in names.txt. However to scrape a fresh copy, remove the names file and add the argument check (can be literally anything, as long as the 3rd argument isn't empty). This will direct puppet to go to adii and retrieve names from the roster ####
